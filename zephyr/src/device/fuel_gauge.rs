//! Device wrapper for a fuel gauge.

//  General recommendations:
// -Clean up comments/docstrings (remove TODOs, clearly document units of returned values in a cohesive way, etc)
// -Run cargo fmt on your code
// -You didn't add wrappers for the plural get/set props functions, which I agree with.
//  I think they are only really necessary if in user mode to batch get/set in a single syscall,
//  but I don't think there is strong need to support that yet, and doing so in idiomatic Rust
//  with type safety could be difficult. Just explain in your PR your reasoning for not including them.
//
// Final recommendation: Add a minimal fuel_gauge sample in samples to just show the basics of how this works.

// `pub(crate) struct FuelGaugeProp(u16)` which would still provide a type safe wrapper around the raw
